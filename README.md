  <strong>open on-premise ecommerce platform</strong><br>
  <i>#StrongRoots #ForwardThinking #FamiliarYetDifferent</i>
</p>

**Maho** is a free and **open source ecommerce platform**, created in 2024 by
[a former maintainer of OpenMage](https://fabrizioballiano.com).
Based on the M1 platform, Maho grants **hyper stability** and a **vast ecosystem of 
modules and extensions**.

**Maho's primary goals** are to propel this wonderful platform into the future, with **high performance,
new features, modern developer-friendly architecture, zero hassles and zero baggage**.

We will try to make Maho as backward compatible as possible, but we won't let the ghosts of the
past to stop the innovation we need to bring to developers and store owners.

### Where does Maho stands in the ecommerce platforms landscape

We believe Maho has a clear space in the plethora of ecommerce platforms:
- Magento2/MageOS: Ideal for large or enterprise on-premise projects
- Maho: Perfect for on-premise medium-to-small projects seeking a modern, streamlined platform
- OpenMage: Suited for more conservative projects that desire complete control
- Shopify: Best for medium-to-small SaaS projects

## Origin, meaning, and pronunciation of Maho

"Maho" ([pronounced as "mah-hoh"](https://www.ingles.com/pronunciacion/majo)) draws inspiration from various
cultural meanings:

- **Maho (or Majo) is the name given to the ancient indigenous people of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura**,
  islands in the Atlantic archipelago of the Canary Islands (Spain), home of this project's maintainer.  
  The Mahos were a **resilient and advanced population who thrived in the challenging island environments**
  before the 15th century. They left significant evidence of their agricultural, social, technological,
  cultural, and spiritual achievements, which continue to impact the culture of the islands to this day.  
  As the Mahos, our platform has a long history, it's simple yet advanced, and it's enduring daring times.
- **In Spanish, it means nice, pleasant, attractive, cool**, who doesn't want a cool platform to build on?
- **In Japanese, it means magic or sorcery**, reflecting the powerful and transformative nature of what
  we want to achieve.

Notice there's no "Mage" in our name? That's intentional.  
While we honor our roots in Magento and OpenMage, it's time for a fresh start.  
Mage was groundbreaking, and we still admire it, but the perception of it being "dead"
became a hurdle for ongoing support and development.  
By adopting a new identity, we're opening doors to new perspectives and possibilities.  
This name change signals to the community that while we build on a solid foundation, we're evolving into something
distinctly powerful and forward-looking.

**Maho is a new tree growing from time-tested roots â€“ familiar in essence, yet branching out in exciting
new directions.**
